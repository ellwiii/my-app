A simple React Native app - its' main goal is to provide users with informations about foreign countries
(cause it has the most sense when used from outside of Poland) in which they are currently located. Based on users geographic coordinates the app provides
them with informations abour current weather, countrie's currency (in reference to PLN) and gives them access to countrie's Wikipedia page.
